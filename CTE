Just like Subqueries, one can use Common Table Expressions (CTE) to perform same functions (average amount paid by top 5 customers)

WITH Average_total_paid_cte (customer_id, first_name, Last_name, city, country) AS
(SELECT B.customer_id, B.first_name, B.last_name, D.city, E.country,
	  SUM (A.amount) AS total_amount_paid
	  FROM customer B
	  INNER JOIN payment A ON B.customer_id = A.customer_id
	  INNER JOIN address C on B.address_id = C.address_id
	  INNER JOIN city D ON C.city_id = D.city_id
	  INNER JOIN country E ON D.country_id = E.country_id
	  WHERE D.city IN ('Aurora', 'Atlixco', 'Xintai', 'Adoni', 'Dhule(Dhulia)', 'Kurashiki', 'Pingxiang',
					  'Sivas', 'Celaya', 'So Leopoldo')
	  GROUP BY B.customer_id, B.first_name, B.last_name, D.city, E.country
	  ORDER BY total_amount_paid DESC 
	  LIMIT 5)
 SELECT AVG (total_amount_paid)
 AS average_amount_paid
 FROM Average_total_paid_cte
