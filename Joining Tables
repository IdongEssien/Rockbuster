We have methods of joining tables in SQL. One of such joins which was used in the project was the *Inner Join* as expessed below

SELECT D.country,
COUNT (customer_id) AS customer_count
FROM customer A
INNER JOIN address B ON A.address_id = B.address_id
INNER JOIN city C ON B.city_id = C.city_id
INNER JOIN country D ON C.country_id = D.country_id
GROUP BY country
ORDER BY customer_count DESC
LIMIT 10;

Other types of joins include *Left Join*, *Right Join*, *Full Join*, *Multiple Joins*. Their usage depends on what the client needs
